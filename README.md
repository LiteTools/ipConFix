# ipConFix
Fixes ipconfig in case anything gets broken. This is very lightweight and will not get updated that much.

## Scripts

* ipConFix.bat - *Does all ipConFix commands.*
* ipConRenew.bat - *Changes your IP address* (Need to research this more)
* ipConList.bat - *Lists ipconfig info.*

## Installation

Download the source code as a .zip and run it.
